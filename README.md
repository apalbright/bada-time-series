This repo has the code/process for making graphs for Bay Area Disc Association

- The R notebook `bada_graphs.Rmd` makes all the `.png` files -- can also see this on [RPubs here](https://rpubs.com/apalbright/covid-time-series-bada)
- The R notebook calls data from a `badata` directory -- this is not included here since I don't have permission to share the data. (Hopefully the code is still useful for seeing the process even without the raw data)
- The main notebook adds images on top of ggplot visuals -- the images it adds are located in `images`
- The main graphs are in `final_graphs`
- Extras and intermediate graphs (on the way to the final ones) that I made are in the `draft` directory
